<p>In about 60 hours from now, I will take a plane to Japan.
It has been about seven years since I last stepped foot in this beautiful country.
This will be my fourth time to go to Japan. I am eager to find out, what has changed and what stayed the same.</p>
<p>I am super excited to go back and will report on the journey as I go. Follow along if you care to get some updates.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, we arrived in Tokyo. It was a quite stressful day and I didn't have much time to take any pictures. We went to</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a translation of my german Drivers License into japanese</li>
<li>Buy Train tickets for the following days which took close to one hour</li>
<li>Reserve bus tickets, also for upcoming holidays, stay tuned.</li>
<li>Explore the area surrounding our hotel for a bit</li>
<li>…and that was it!</li>
</ul>
<p>Today however was different.</p>

<p>We started today in Ginza, to check out the Flagship Store of Muji, a quite famous department store where we bought a nail scissor (or something close to it, surprinsingly hard to find nail scissors in Japan).
<img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_121510_00.JPG" alt="image">
Aparently, there is a christian church in the middle of Ginza in this architecturaly stunning building.</p>
<p>We had Sushi for Breakfast that was pretty great, afterwards we went to another department Store: LOFT, where we found this:
<img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_141222_00.JPG" alt="what is that supposed to be">
&quot;Cha&quot; Means tea in Japanese. Apparently you can buy tea that has been placed inside cigarette shells… Only in Japan.</p>
<p><img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_144349_00.JPG" alt="image">
This one was shot right outside the LOFT department store, I love high contrast shots like this.</p>
<p>We then went on to Yoyogi park and Meiji Shrine.
<img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_163003_00.JPG" alt="image">
Right outside Meiji Shrine, you can find those Sake barrels wrapped in straw that were gifted to Emperor Meiji for his accomplishments.
<img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_163233_00.JPG" alt="image">
We then ate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dango">Dango</a>, A japanese Snack, typically eaten at festivals in Japan. It consists of Rice Cake covered in Sweet and Salty sauce.</p>
<p><img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_165545_00.jpg" alt="image">
We checked out Takeshita Dori next which was so crowded that we immediately left again
<img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_171808_00.JPG" alt="image">
Instead, we checked out Cat alley, which was way more calm, this and the following two pictures are taken of a side street of Cat Street. Quite lovely.</p>

<p>We finished the evening by going to Monzennakacho which is a bit off the beaten path in Tokyo. Didn't see many tourists there (or anyone for that matter) but the shops were quite pleasing to look at in the light of the already set sun. The rest of the pictures in this post are from Monzennakacho.

We ate at &quot;Daruma&quot; were we were the only foreigners in sight. The waitress was quite friendly and served us tasty dishes. What a day!</p>

      <p>Tonight, we felt the Jetlag for the first time for real. We both couldn't sleep until 2AM. Either way, we woke up at 9AM to get used to the Japanese Time. The Sun in Japan rises before 5AM and sets shortly after 6PM, so there is not much time to enjoy the daylight if you get up too late.</p>

<p>Today was a public holiday. In most of the city, not much was going on. In other areas, everyone was shopping. I tried to reflect that contrast with the pictures I selected for this post.</p>
<p>It had been raining the night before. This created a nice atmosphere in the city.</p>

A park ranger patrolling at a Japanese Playground. Coming from Germany, it is quite bizzare to see people at parks and playgrounds whose only job it is, to keep the vicinity of the park safe.</p>
<p><img src="/images/japan03/2023-04-30_110509_00.JPG" alt="We had breakfast and coffee at Blue Bottle coffee in Roppongi">
We had breakfast and coffee at Blue Bottle coffee in Roppongi. It used to be very hard to find places where you can enjoy food and beverages outside… Now I saw way more shops in Tokyo where you can eat and drink while <em>also</em> sitting outside. Quite the nice change, if you ask me. Anyway, Blue bottle Coffee was always one of the coffee shops, where you could sit outside. It is a hipster place with hipster prices but I quite enjoy the surrounding area and the calm and quiet right next to otherwise busy areas of the city.</p>
<p><img src="/images/japan03/2023-04-30_111629_00.JPG" alt="Koinobori in a public park in Japan">
Since it is now golden Week in Japan, the longest stretch of public holidays in a row, there are a few festivities associated with these occasions. These fishes are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koinobori">Koinobori</a> and are flown for Childrens day in Japan which is at May 5 this year. Childrens Day marks the end of the public holiday season that is Golden Week.</p>
<p><img src="/images/japan03/2023-04-30_112420_00.JPG" alt="Cityscape of Tokyo">
I just love cityscapes like that. Here you can see, how few cars were on the road today.</p>
<p><img src="/images/japan03/2023-04-30_123800_00.JPG" alt="Fruits and vegetables store">
Our destination of the day was Chazawa-dori in Sangenjaya, a shopping street that is closed for car traffic on Sunday. It is lined with pretty shops, restaurant and cafés but also traditional stores, local stores and just regular fruit and vegetable stores like this one pictured here.</p>
<p><img src="/images/japan03/2023-04-30_123940_00.JPG" alt="Life Size King Kong Figure">
For some reason, there is a giant King Kong Figure, picking up a small girl hanging from the side of a building. Check the scale of the people compared to the statue!</p>
<p><img src="/images/japan03/2023-04-30_124729_00.JPG" alt="Small Coffee Shop in Chazawa-dori">
Small shops like this (in this case a coffee shop) are the reason I love Japan so much. Just look at all the details!</p>
<p><img src="/images/japan03/2023-04-30_133035_00.JPG" alt="Entrance to Shimokitazawa">
At the end of Chazawa-dori, you can find Shimokitazawa, a very popular area that gained a lot of popularity since I first visited Japan in 2014. This area is known for second hand clothing and furniture and also has a lot of restaurants. As you can see, it was packed! Everyone was using their day off to do a bit of shopping and catch up with friends.</p>
<p><img src="/images/japan03/2023-04-30_150211_00.JPG" alt="Playing Shogi in the streets">
There was a tournament of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi">Shogi</a> (also called Japanese Chess) held in the streets. It was quite interesting to watch. Bystanders were very engaged with every move the players did.</p>
<p><img src="/images/japan03/2023-04-30_150538_00.JPG" alt="Front door with technology and beautiful decay">
Beautiful mess of colors, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi">Wabisabi</a> (beautiful decay) and technology.</p>
<p><img src="/images/japan03/2023-04-30_182803_00.JPG" alt="Wooden House in modern City">
This traditional japanese wooden house is close to our hotel and stands in stark contrast to the rest of the surrounding, which is super modern.</p>

View from our hotel window in the morning</p>
<p>Today, we woke up early at around 7:30 AM and left for Shinjuku Station to reach our next destination: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Alps">Japanese Alps</a>. We got up so early in fact, that we had an hour to waste at Shinjuku Station. After looking for a Bento (Lunchbox) but failing to find one, we decided to go to the only(!) Café, we could see in the vicinity. The food was okay, nothing to write home about. Then we checked out our train - and found Bento!
It was being sold directly on the platform of our departure. Pretty convenient. (Later I found out, that all the rest of the shops and restaurants were on a completely different floor of the station… Japan, you can be confusing at times.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/japan04/2023-05-01_093107_00.JPG" alt="Drinks in Train form">
The Bento-Shop sold Drinks in the form of little Trains, why not?</p>
<p>Our train left Shinjuku punctually at 10 AM sharp – and we were off. The weather was nice, the train was spotless, the Wi-Fi on the train worked. Everything was dandy!</p>
<p><img src="/images/japan04/2023-05-01_111309_00.JPG" alt="Image of Bento on a Train">
After about 2 hours of riding the train, I decided to crack open my Bento box. It was underwhelmingly bland but did the job of making me less hungry.</p>
<p>This is also, where things went south. There was a signal disturbance that affected our train. We had to make an impromptu stop and then nothing happened for about 1:30 hours. Except for the train clerk anouncing over and over again that they were sorry and that there was a problem with the signal and that they are working to fix it and that it would probably be fixed soon.</p>
<p>We reached our transfer station just one minute late for us to catch our connecting train to our destination. So we had to wait another hour. So all in all, I had a lot of time to think about and observe the behaviour of people. Some things I noted were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Japanese people don't wear sunglasses (Of course some do but surprisingly little. During our trip I saw 2 Japanese people out of maybe 100 that would wear sunglasses and - as said - it was a sunny day today)</li>
<li>On our route, there was very little renewable energy and thinking back, I never noticed wind power in all my travels in Japan. Also, there was only one solar park on the whole route from Tokyo to the Japanese Alps.</li>
<li>People travelling to the Japanese Alps are serious about hiking. Most people wore functional clothes, hiking boots, some even walking/hiking sticks, even though the terrain in the Japanese alps is easy to moderate compared to most hiking routes in Austria/Switzerland/Norway…</li>
<li>There are amazing restrooms everywhere but most of them don't have soap in them. So prepare to bring your own sanitizer!</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/japan04/2023-05-01_162426_00.JPG" alt="image">
At 3:45 PM, we reached our destination: Narai-Juku! A post-town in the Japanese Alps. These towns were laying on the route of the post transports between Kyoto and Tokyo. A few hundred years later, a lot of the houses are still pretty well kept and people still actually still work an live here – mostly in the tourism industry of course.</p>
<p>We checked into our Minshuku (Guest House) shortly after arriving. It is located right in the town center with very pretty houses all around!</p>
<p>We walked around in Narai-Juku and found some cute shops. We had such a lovely &quot;talk&quot; (we tried to communicate in all the ways possible) with an elderly lady that sold us handmade postcards that her deceased husband made (they were 1€ each). Encounters like this make the trip to Japan completely worth it!
<img src="/images/japan04/2023-05-01_165947_00.JPG" alt="image">
At 5PM, most of the shops close and thus, most of the people leave Narai-Juku. Finally, we could take some pictures without people in them!
<img src="/images/japan04/2023-05-01_170440_00.JPG" alt="image">
I didn't realise, that cars could also pass through this ancient town which kind of &quot;ruins the vibe&quot; but I guess it's necessary since this town is still actively lived in and not only a backdrop for pretty pictures.
<img src="/images/japan04/2023-05-01_172200_00.JPG" alt="image">
Anyway, here's the last picture of pretty houses (for today).
<img src="/images/japan04/2023-05-01_180155_00.JPG" alt="image">
At 6 PM it was dinner time. I was pretty hungry before so I had a few nuts.</p>
<p>The dinner started with just a few plates, pictured above. Our host gave us only this much information about the proceedings of the evening: &quot;Dinner is served between 6 PM and 7:15 PM&quot;. I thought: Good, that I ate some nuts before since this is not much at all! Next, our host brought out boiled vegetables that we could dip into a sauce that he prepared. Pretty nice but I was still hungry, I ate two bowls of rice with that. There were a lot more courses to follow after that though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clam chowder</li>
<li>Grilled Trout</li>
<li>Horse Sashimi (delicious with garlic sauce!)</li>
<li>Tempura</li>
<li>Miso Soup</li>
<li>Fruits</li>
<li>Ice cream</li>
</ul>
<p>I left about 2kg heavier than before. Everything was delicious, prepared with care and served with love. I was happily surprised!
<img src="/images/japan04/2023-05-01_161343_00.JPG" alt="image">
We finished the evening by going to the bath in the Guest House which was reserved especially for us! It was a Japanese Sento: A bath were you wash yourself before resting in the hot water (thermal bath). It is soo relaxing to feel the warmth on your tired muscles.</p>
<p>Aparently, in Japan, my name is Mr. Jonas.</p>
