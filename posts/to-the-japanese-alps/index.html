We got up so early in fact, that we had an hour to waste at Shinjuku Station. After looking for a Bento (Lunchbox) but failing to find one, we decided to go to the only(!) Caf√©, we could see in the vicinity. The food was okay, nothing to write home about. Then we checked out our train - and found Bento! It was being sold directly on the platform of our departure. Pretty convenient. (Later I found out, that all the rest of the shops and restaurants were on a completely different floor of the station‚Ä¶ Japan, you can be confusing at times.)</p><blockquote><p>Check out an interactive Map of the places we visited <a href="https://wanderlog.com/view/ipgoeoyijw/japan-trip/shared">here</a>. I will update this map as we continue our Journey. This post is about Day 4.</p></blockquote><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/bvxgzz5wOA-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/bvxgzz5wOA-2000.jpeg" alt="Drinks in Train form" width="2000" height="1333"></picture>The Bento-Shop sold Drinks in the form of little Trains, why not?</p><p>Our train left Shinjuku punctually at 10 AM sharp ‚Äì and we were off. The weather was nice, the train was spotless, the Wi-Fi on the train worked. Everything was dandy!</p><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/YPNzWb6l-x-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/YPNzWb6l-x-2000.jpeg" alt="Image of Bento on a Train" width="2000" height="1124"></picture>After about 2 hours of riding the train, I decided to crack open my Bento box. It was underwhelmingly bland but did the job of making me less hungry.</p><p>This is also, where things went south. There was a signal disturbance that affected our train. We had to make an impromptu stop and then nothing happened for about 1:30 hours. Except for the train clerk anouncing over and over again that they were sorry and that there was a problem with the signal and that they are working to fix it and that it would probably be fixed soon.</p><p>We reached our transfer station just one minute late for us to catch our connecting train to our destination. So we had to wait another hour. So all in all, I had a lot of time to think about and observe the behaviour of people. Some things I noted were:</p><ul><li>Japanese people don't wear sunglasses (Of course some do but surprisingly little. During our trip I saw 2 Japanese people out of maybe 100 that would wear sunglasses and - as said - it was a sunny day today)</li><li>On our route, there was very little renewable energy and thinking back, I never noticed wind power in all my travels in Japan. Also, there was only one solar park on the whole route from Tokyo to the Japanese Alps.</li><li>People traveling to the Japanese Alps are serious about hiking. Most people wore functional clothes, hiking boots, some even walking/hiking sticks, even though the terrain in the Japanese alps is easy to moderate compared to most hiking routes in Austria/Switzerland/Norway‚Ä¶</li><li>There are amazing restrooms everywhere but most of them don't have soap in them. So prepare to bring your own sanitizer!</li></ul><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/e1nGFTPPWJ-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/e1nGFTPPWJ-2000.jpeg" alt="image" width="2000" height="1333"></picture>At 3:45 PM, we reached our destination: Narai-Juku! A post-town in the Japanese Alps. These towns were laying on the route of the post transports between Kyoto and Tokyo. A few hundred years later, a lot of the houses are still pretty well kept and people still actually still work an live here ‚Äì mostly in the tourism industry of course.</p><p>We checked into our Minshuku (Guest House) shortly after arriving. It is located right in the town center with very pretty houses all around!</p><p>We walked around in Narai-Juku and found some cute shops. We had such a lovely &quot;talk&quot; (we tried to communicate in all the ways possible) with an elderly lady that sold us handmade postcards that her deceased husband made (they were 1‚Ç¨ each). Encounters like this make the trip to Japan completely worth it!<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/1qR-x_4zKu-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/1qR-x_4zKu-2000.jpeg" alt="image" width="2000" height="1998"></picture>At 5PM, most of the shops close and thus, most of the people leave Narai-Juku. Finally, we could take some pictures without people in them!<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/iyyyQGetS9-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/iyyyQGetS9-2000.jpeg" alt="image" width="2000" height="1333"></picture>I didn't realise, that cars could also pass through this ancient town which kind of &quot;ruins the vibe&quot; but I guess it's necessary since this town is still actively lived in and not only a backdrop for pretty pictures.<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/PQtSwNvjlZ-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/PQtSwNvjlZ-2000.jpeg" alt="image" width="2000" height="1333"></picture>Anyway, here's the last picture of pretty houses (for today).<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/h2FoIi7nDg-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/h2FoIi7nDg-2000.jpeg" alt="image" width="2000" height="2011"></picture>At 6 PM it was dinner time. I was pretty hungry before so I had a few nuts.</p><p>The dinner started with just a few plates, pictured above. Our host gave us only this much information about the proceedings of the evening: &quot;Dinner is served between 6 PM and 7:15 PM&quot;. I thought: Good, that I ate some nuts before since this is not much at all! Next, our host brought out boiled vegetables that we could dip into a sauce that he prepared. Pretty nice but I was still hungry, I ate two bowls of rice with that. There were a lot more courses to follow after that though:</p><ul><li>Clam chowder</li><li>Grilled Trout</li><li>Horse Sashimi (delicious with garlic sauce!)</li><li>Tempura</li><li>Miso Soup</li><li>Fruits</li><li>Ice cream</li></ul><p>I left about 2kg heavier than before. Everything was delicious, prepared with care and served with love. I was happily surprised!<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/I_fs4XODCR-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/I_fs4XODCR-2000.jpeg" alt="image" width="2000" height="1495"></picture>We finished the evening by going to the bath in the Guest House which was reserved especially for us! It was a Japanese Sento: A bath were you wash yourself before resting in the hot water (thermal bath). It is soo relaxing to feel the warmth on your tired muscles.</p><p>Aparently, in Japan, my name is Mr. Jonas.</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/travel/">#travel</a></div><nav class="post__pagination"><a href="/posts/hiking-the-nakasendo/"><span>‚Üê</span> <span>Hiking the Nakasendo</span> </a><a href="/posts/last-day-in-tokyo/"><span>Last day in Tokyo</span> <span>‚Üí</span></a></nav></aside></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><ul class="hero__social-links"><li><a href="https://instagram.com/ununun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/joans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS</a></li><li><a href="/impressum">Impressum und Datenschutz</a></li></ul><p class="footer__attribution">Created by <a href="https://twitter.com/yinkakun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yinka,</a> Powered by <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11ty,</a> Checkout <a href="https://github.com/yinkakun/eleventy-duo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project's github repo</a></p></div></footer></div><script src="/assets/main.31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c.js"></script></body></html>
