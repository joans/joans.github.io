We took the first train at 8:12 AM and reached our accomodation at 3:15 PM. So in total, we travelled over 7 hours. It was pretty warm as well with 26¬∞ C and a lot of local trains were not air conditioned. So it was an exhausting day and not many pictures were taken.</p><blockquote><p>Check out an interactive Map of the places we visited <a href="https://wanderlog.com/view/ipgoeoyijw/japan-trip/shared">here</a>. I will update this map as we continue our Journey. This post is about Day 8.</p></blockquote><p>Our destination today were the historic villages of Gokayama. The traditional houses there make up for some pretty unique sights. They are built in a particular style called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minka">Gassho-Zukuri</a>. We made the choice to go to this remote location to avoid the big crowds of Golden week in major touristic hotspots.</p><p><img src="/images/japan08/2023-05-05_120027_00.jpg" alt="View of Japanese Alps"> We took ALL the trains (plus a bus at the end). From the slow local trains that stop everywhere to the Shinkansen that reaches top speeds of over 200 km/h there was a nice variety. The views of the Japanese Alps were pretty spectacular as you can see above.</p><p>One thing we learned today: Taking trains during golden week is <em>fine</em>. They can get crowded which can be a bit unpleasant but it is not as bad as I would have thought. Sometimes you have to stand for a couple of minutes before a seat becomes available and that's about the most uncomfotable it gets. <img src="/images/japan08/2023-05-05_144232_00.jpg" alt="Earthquake alert"> When reaching Gokayama, all the phones in the bus were sounding an alarm for an earthquake that would have &quot;strong shaking&quot;. The sound of the alarm startled me. I asked myself what I should do with the information to best prepare myself for &quot;strong shaking&quot; but I couldn't think of anything. A couple seconds later, there was a mild shifting back and forth (like a bus usually does anyway ) and that was it. Later that day, there was another alert in the accomodation and this one was a bit more noticeable. But all in all I am pretty excited that after 3 trips in Japan, I finally experienced an earthquake! <img src="/images/japan08/2023-05-05_145344_00.jpg" alt="Gassho-Zukuri Houses at the Entrance of Kaminashi"> When we got out at our bus stop, we already saw some Gassho-Zukuri style houses at the entrance of our village that we stayed in for the night.</p><p>The following two images show the surroundings of the village. Yeah, it is pretty remote! <img src="/images/japan08/2023-05-05_145906_00.jpg" alt="Village with river"> <img src="/images/japan08/2023-05-05_150630_00.jpg" alt="Remote location with road"> When we finally arrived at the accomodation, we just laid on the floor for an hour or so. We ate dinner and played some cards and called it a day.</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/travel/">#travel</a></div><nav class="post__pagination"><a href="/posts/gokayama/"><span>‚Üê</span> <span>Gokayama</span> </a><a href="/posts/relaxing-in-the-japanese-countryside/"><span>Relaxing in the Japanese Countryside</span> <span>‚Üí</span></a></nav></aside></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><ul class="hero__social-links"><li><a href="https://instagram.com/ununun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/joans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS</a></li><li><a href="/impressum">Impressum und Datenschutz</a></li></ul><p class="footer__attribution">Created by <a href="https://twitter.com/yinkakun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yinka,</a> Powered by <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11ty,</a> Checkout <a href="https://github.com/yinkakun/eleventy-duo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project's github repo</a></p></div></footer></div><script src="/assets/main.31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c.js"></script></body></html>
