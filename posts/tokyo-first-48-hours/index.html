Didn't see many tourists there (or anyone for that matter) but the shops were quite pleasing to look at in the light of the already set sun. The rest of the pictures in this post are from Monzennakacho.<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/CoaiZVnoFd-2000.webp 2000w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/CoaiZVnoFd-2000.jpeg" alt="image" width="2000" height="1333"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/0xF9_dX5Ww-2000.webp 2000w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/0xF9_dX5Ww-2000.jpeg" alt="image" width="2000" height="1333"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/vN2oqEDAkO-2000.webp 2000w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/vN2oqEDAkO-2000.jpeg" alt="image" width="2000" height="1333"></picture>We ate at &quot;Daruma&quot; were we were the only foreigners in sight.
