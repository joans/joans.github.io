I will update this map as we continue our Journey.</p></blockquote><p>We started today in Ginza, to check out the Flagship Store of Muji, a quite famous department store where we bought a nail scissor (or something close to it, surprinsingly hard to find nail scissors in Japan). <img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_121510_00.JPG" alt="image"> Aparently, there is a christian church in the middle of Ginza in this architecturaly stunning building.</p><p>We had Sushi for Breakfast that was pretty great, afterwards we went to another department Store: LOFT, where we found this: <img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_141222_00.JPG" alt="what is that supposed to be"> &quot;Cha&quot; Means tea in Japanese. Apparently you can buy tea that has been placed inside cigarette shells‚Ä¶ Only in Japan.</p><p><img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_144349_00.JPG" alt="image"> This one was shot right outside the LOFT department store, I love high contrast shots like this.</p><p>We then went on to Yoyogi park and Meiji Shrine. <img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_163003_00.JPG" alt="image"> Right outside Meiji Shrine, you can find those Sake barrels wrapped in straw that were gifted to Emperor Meiji for his accomplishments. <img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_163233_00.JPG" alt="image"> We then ate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dango">Dango</a>, A japanese Snack, typically eaten at festivals in Japan. It consists of Rice Cake covered in Sweet and Salty sauce.</p><p><img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_165545_00.jpg" alt="image"> We checked out Takeshita Dori next which was so crowded that we immediately left again <img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_171808_00.JPG" alt="image"> Instead, we checked out Cat alley, which was way more calm, this and the following two pictures are taken of a side street of Cat Street. Quite lovely.</p><p><img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_173321_00.JPG" alt="image"> <img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_174553_00.JPG" alt="image"></p><p>We finished the evening by going to Monzennakacho which is a bit off the beaten path in Tokyo. Didn't see many tourists there (or anyone for that matter) but the shops were quite pleasing to look at in the light of the already set sun. The rest of the pictures in this post are from Monzennakacho. <img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_182755_00.JPG" alt="image"> <img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_182945_00.JPG" alt="image"> <img src="/images/japan02/2023-04-29_191257_00.JPG" alt="image"> We ate at &quot;Daruma&quot; were we were the only foreigners in sight. The waitress was quite friendly and served us tasty dishes.
