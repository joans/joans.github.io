We both couldn't sleep until 2AM. Either way, we woke up at 9AM to get used to the Japanese Time. The Sun in Japan rises before 5AM and sets shortly after 6PM, so there is not much time to enjoy the daylight if you get up too late.</p><blockquote><p>Check out an interactive Map of the places we visited <a href="https://wanderlog.com/view/ipgoeoyijw/japan-trip/shared">here</a>. I will update this map as we continue our Journey. This post is about Day 3.</p></blockquote><p>Today was a public holiday. In most of the city, not much was going on. In other areas, everyone was shopping. I tried to reflect that contrast with the pictures I selected for this post.</p><p>It had been raining the night before. This created a nice atmosphere in the city.</p><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/zyYmKQYl2r-2000.webp 2000w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/zyYmKQYl2r-2000.jpeg" alt="A man cleaning up in front of a supermarket" width="2000" height="1333"></picture>A man cleaning up in front of a supermarket.</p><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/Y-BT7u1TkQ-2000.webp 2000w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/Y-BT7u1TkQ-2000.jpeg" alt="A park ranger patrolling at a Japanese Playground" width="2000" height="1321"></picture>A park ranger patrolling at a Japanese Playground.

It used to be very hard to find places where you can enjoy food and beverages outside‚Ä¶ Now I saw way more shops in Tokyo where you can eat and drink while <em>also</em> sitting outside. Quite the nice change, if you ask me. Anyway, Blue bottle Coffee was always one of the coffee shops, where you could sit outside. It is a hipster place with hipster prices but I quite enjoy the surrounding area and the calm and quiet right next to otherwise busy areas of the city.</p><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/oeCzspv4eb-2000.webp 2000w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/oeCzspv4eb-2000.jpeg" alt="Koinobori in a public park in Japan" width="2000" height="1333"></picture>Since it is now golden Week in Japan, the longest stretch of public holidays in a row, there are a few festivities associated with these occasions. These fishes are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koinobori">Koinobori</a> and are flown for Childrens day in Japan which is at May 5 this year. Childrens Day marks the end of the public holiday season that is Golden Week.</p><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/vali-JWuAW-1667.webp 1667w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/vali-JWuAW-1667.jpeg" alt="Cityscape of Tokyo" width="1667" height="2500"></picture>I just love cityscapes like that.

This area is known for second hand clothing and furniture and also has a lot of restaurants. As you can see, it was packed! Everyone was using their day off to do a bit of shopping and catch up with friends.</p><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/dKi1ZSgJHR-2000.webp 2000w"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/img/dKi1ZSgJHR-2000.jpeg" alt="Playing Shogi in the streets" width="2000" height="1333"></picture>There was a tournament of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi">Shogi</a> (also called Japanese Chess) held in the streets.
