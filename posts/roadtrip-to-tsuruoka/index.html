That's when I took this picture.</p><p>Back in Niigata, we picked up the car and paid our 10‚Ç¨ parking fee for 48 hours. Our next destination: Tsuroka. We booked this accommodation because it's about halfway between Niigata and our northernmost destination: Morioka.</p><p>The lodging was an old ryokan (guesthouse) in Tsuruoka. Both dinner and breakfast were delicious teishoku (Japanese set meals) made with local ingredients and prepared with care. I took some pictures of the food, but they don't do it justice, so I'll skip posting them.</p><p>In the morning, we got up early and went to the Dewasanzan Shrine which was just around the corner from the Ryokan.<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/binT0diKeU-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/binT0diKeU-2000.jpeg" alt="Hiking to Mount Haguro" width="2000" height="1124"></picture>After walking down a steep set of stone stairs, we reached this red bridge that led us onto the trail.</p><p>We were very lucky that it was still early, as there were not many other people around and we had the opportunity to take some scenic pictures.<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/KkP-bhRIpB-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/KkP-bhRIpB-2000.jpeg" alt="Five Story Pagoda" width="2000" height="2500"></picture>On the left you can see a 1000 year old cedar tree, which is considered to be the grandfather of the forest, on the right there is a five story pagoda.<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/L0htR2AxXi-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/L0htR2AxXi-2000.jpeg" alt="Light falling through the trees at mount Haguro" width="2000" height="1333"></picture>We were also very lucky with the light, the sun was just shining through the leaves and with the early morning mist the light rays were visible.<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/irLFSmoNnf-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/irLFSmoNnf-2000.jpeg" alt="Five Story Pagoda up close" width="2000" height="3000"></picture>The five story pagoda in relation to a regular sized human.<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/I4NUCnJRqS-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/I4NUCnJRqS-2000.jpeg" alt="Going up the mountain" width="2000" height="2500"></picture>After the tree and the pagoda, the real hike began: stone stairs upon stone stairs. You couldn't even see the end of them.<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/31JHLdzM95-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/31JHLdzM95-2000.jpeg" alt="Lightfall on top the mountain" width="2000" height="1333"></picture>Luckily, there were always flat sections in between the steep stairs.<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/uoFp6tHjE--2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/uoFp6tHjE--2000.jpeg" alt="Enjoying the view" width="2000" height="1333"></picture>Sometimes we just had to stop and admire the beauty of the forest.</p><p>At the top of the mountain there is a Shinto shrine, a museum, and some other buildings. The beauty of the shrine paled in comparison to the hike through nature that preceded it.<picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/img/AesxaGbCcu-2000.webp 2000w"><img decoding="async" src="/img/AesxaGbCcu-2000.jpeg" alt="Oufukasawa Bridge in Autumn" width="2000" height="1500"></picture>On our way to our next destination, we made a quick stop at the Oufukasawa Bridge, which is known for its beautiful fall colors. The further north we got, the more fall colors we saw.</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/travel/">#travel</a> <a href="/tags/photo/">#photo</a> <a href="/tags/japan/">#japan</a></div><nav class="post__pagination"><a href="/posts/morioka-day-one/"><span>‚Üê</span> <span>Morioka, Day one</span> </a><a href="/posts/sado-island/"><span>Sado Island</span> <span>‚Üí</span></a></nav></aside></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><ul class="hero__social-links"><li><a href="https://instagram.com/ununun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/joans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS</a></li><li><a href="/impressum">Impressum und Datenschutz</a></li></ul><p class="footer__attribution">Created by <a href="https://twitter.com/yinkakun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yinka,</a> Powered by <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11ty,</a> Checkout <a href="https://github.com/yinkakun/eleventy-duo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project's github repo</a></p></div></footer></div><script src="/assets/main.31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c.js"></script></body></html>
